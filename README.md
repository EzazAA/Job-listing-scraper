   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure the Scraper:**

   Open the `scraper.py` file and modify the `url` variable to point to the job listing website you want to scrape. Ensure you have the correct selectors for the job elements based on the website's HTML structure.

2. **Run the Scraper:**

   Execute the scraper script to start collecting job listings:

   ```sh
   python scraper.py
   ```

3. **View the Output:**

   The collected job listings will be saved to a CSV file named `job_listings.csv` in the project directory. You can open this file with any spreadsheet software or analyze it using Python libraries like `pandas`.

## Example

Here’s a simple example of how the scraper works:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

def get_jobs(url):
    jobs = []
    while url:
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
            job_elements = soup.find_all('div', class_='job-listing')
            for job in job_elements:
                title = job.find('h2').text
                company = job.find('span', class_='company').text
                location = job.find('span', class_='location').text
                jobs.append({'title': title, 'company': company, 'location': location})
            
            next_page = soup.find('a', class_='next-page')
            url = next_page['href'] if next_page else None
        else:
            print("Failed to retrieve the page")
            break
    return jobs

jobs = get_jobs('https://example.com/jobs')
df = pd.DataFrame(jobs)
df.to_csv('job_listings.csv', index=False)
```
